# About this example website

This is an example website created using the [ZooDb
package](https://github.com/phfaist/zoodb).  It is not meant to serve any other
purpose than to illustrate how to use this JavaScript library to build a simple
website displaying information stored in a database of YAML files.

You can edit the data files, or add additional data files, in the
`zoodb/example/data` folder.  Go ahead and play around :)

This example website is powered by the wonderful [eleventy static website
generator](https://11ty.dev/) and [parceljs bundler](https://parceljs.org/).
Content template files can be written in HTML, JavaScript, Markdown, and more.
Try it out!
